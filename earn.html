            <p class="hero">In Cosmo Bear, you can earn <img class="coin" src="coin.webp" alt="Coins" /> coins by tapping and traveling through space. Here's how you can maximize your earnings</p>



            <div class="section">
                <h2>Basic Earning</h2>
                <p>Every tap helps Barry travel 1 KM, earning you 1 coin. Initially, each tap travels 1 KM, but you can increase the distance traveled per tap by purchasing boosts. More distance per tap means more <img class="coin" src="coin.webp" alt="Coins" /> coins earned per tap!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section highlight">
                <p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use boosts to increase your KM per tap and maximize your coin earnings!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Exploring Galaxies</h2>
                <p>When you complete traveling through a galaxy, you will earn a significant amount of coin rewards for your exploration. Keep exploring new galaxies to earn more <img class="coin" src="coin.webp" alt="Coins" /> coins!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Completing Challenges</h2>
                <p>In the Earn section or via your radar, you will find various challenges that offer different coin rewards. These challenges are designed to help Barry reach his goals faster. Make sure to complete them all to maximize your earnings!</p>
            </div>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Inviting Friends</h2>

            <div class="section">
                <h2>Space Treasures</h2>
                <p>Space is full of treasures, and Barry is collecting them.
