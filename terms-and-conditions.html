            <h3>5.3 Efforts to List Tokens</h3>
            <p>The Company is committed to making every effort to list the tokens ($CBX) on major exchanges globally to enhance their utility and accessibility. While the Company is optimistic about the potential for listing, it cannot provide an absolute guarantee that the tokens will be listed or that they will be tradeable for fiat currency.

            <h3>5.4 Trading Tokens</h3>
